# üîó Dashboard ‚ÜîÔ∏è Bot Integration Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your dashboard is properly connected to your Discord bot.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Installation ‚úÖ

- [ ] Node.js 18+ is installed
- [ ] You have access to your bot's SQLite database file
- [ ] You know the path to your bot's database
- [ ] You have a code editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## Phase 2: Dashboard Setup ‚úÖ

- [ ] Cloned/downloaded the dashboard project
- [ ] Opened terminal in dashboard directory
- [ ] Ran `npm install` successfully
- [ ] All packages installed without errors
- [ ] Created `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)

---

## Phase 3: Database Connection ‚úÖ

- [ ] Located your bot's SQLite database file
- [ ] Verified database file is accessible
- [ ] Set `DATABASE_PATH` in `.env` to correct location
- [ ] Tested database path is valid

**Test Database Access:**
```powershell
# Check if file exists
Test-Path "C:\path\to\your\database.sqlite"

# Should return: True
```

---

## Phase 4: Schema Verification ‚úÖ

### Check Your Bot's Database Structure

Run this in your bot's directory (if you have sqlite3 installed):
```bash
sqlite3 database.sqlite ".schema"
```

### Verify Required Table Exists

- [ ] `user_stats` table exists (or similar)
- [ ] Table has `user_id` column (or equivalent)
- [ ] Table has `server_id` column (or equivalent)
- [ ] Table has `exp` or `experience` column
- [ ] Table has `level` column
- [ ] Table has `username` column

### If Column Names Differ

- [ ] Noted differences in table/column names
- [ ] Updated queries in `lib/database/queries.ts` to match
- [ ] Saved changes

**Example Mapping:**
```typescript
// If your bot uses 'guild_id' instead of 'server_id'
const query = `SELECT * FROM user_stats WHERE guild_id = ?`;
//                                              ^^^^^^^^ changed

// If your bot uses 'xp' instead of 'exp'
const query = `SELECT user_id, xp as exp FROM user_stats`;
//                              ^^^^^^^^^ aliased
```

## Phase 5: Configuration ‚úÖ

### Environment Variables

- [ ] `DATABASE_PATH` is set
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_BOT_NAME` is set
- [ ] Path uses correct format for your OS
- [ ] No quotes around paths in `.env`

**Example `.env`:**
```env
DATABASE_PATH=C:\Users\Daniel\bot\database.sqlite
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISCORD_BOT_NAME=Andromeda Bot
```

### Test Configuration

- [ ] Ran `npm run dev`
- [ ] No errors in terminal
- [ ] Server started on port 3000
- [ ] Browser opens to http://localhost:3000

---

## Phase 6: Data Verification ‚úÖ

### Dashboard Pages

- [ ] **Dashboard** (`/`) loads without errors
- [ ] **Leaderboard** (`/leaderboard`) loads
- [ ] Server selector appears in header
- [ ] Server selector shows available servers

### Data Display

- [ ] Statistics show on dashboard (not all zeros)
- [ ] Leaderboard shows users
- [ ] User avatars display correctly
- [ ] User levels and XP are visible
- [ ] Can search for users on leaderboard

---

## Phase 7: Functionality Testing ‚úÖ

### Server Selection

- [ ] Can click server selector dropdown
- [ ] Multiple servers appear (if applicable)
- [ ] Can switch between servers
- [ ] Data updates when server changes

### Leaderboard

- [ ] Users are ranked by experience
- [ ] Top 3 users have medal icons
- [ ] Search box filters users
- [ ] All columns display data

### API Endpoints

- [ ] `/api/servers` returns server list
- [ ] `/api/leaderboard?serverId=123` returns data
- [ ] `/api/servers/stats?serverId=123` returns stats

**Test API:**
```powershell
# Should return JSON data
curl http://localhost:3000/api/servers
```

---

## Phase 8: Troubleshooting ‚úÖ

### If No Data Appears

- [ ] Checked browser console for errors (F12)
- [ ] Verified database has data (run SQL query)
- [ ] Confirmed table names match in queries
- [ ] Checked server_id values match Discord IDs

### If Database Connection Fails

- [ ] Verified DATABASE_PATH is absolute path
- [ ] Checked file permissions
- [ ] Ensured database is SQLite format
- [ ] Tried restarting dashboard server

### If TypeScript Errors Persist

- [ ] Ran `npm install` again
- [ ] Deleted `node_modules` and reinstalled
- [ ] Restarted VS Code
- [ ] Checked `tsconfig.json` is valid

---

## Phase 9: Customization (Optional) ‚úÖ

- [ ] Changed bot name in `.env`
- [ ] Customized colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- [ ] Updated leveling formula (if different)
- [ ] Modified UI to preference
- [ ] Added additional pages (if desired)

---

## Phase 10: Production Ready (Optional) ‚úÖ

- [ ] Ran `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Tested production build with `npm start`
- [ ] Optimized database with indexes
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configured for deployment (if hosting)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your dashboard is successfully connected if:

‚úÖ Dashboard loads without errors
‚úÖ Statistics display real data from bot
‚úÖ Leaderboard shows actual users
‚úÖ Server selector works
‚úÖ All API endpoints return data
‚úÖ No console errors in browser

---

## üìã Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Database connection failed" | Check `DATABASE_PATH` in `.env` |
| "No data showing" | Verify table/column names match |
| "Can't find module" | Run `npm install` |
| "Port already in use" | Kill process on port 3000 or change port |
| "TypeScript errors" | Install dependencies, restart editor |
| "404 on API routes" | Ensure server is running on correct port |

---

## üîÑ Next Steps After Setup

1. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check dashboard speed with large datasets
   - Add database indexes if queries are slow

2. **Customize Features**
   - Add more pages (users, stats, etc.)
   - Implement authentication
   - Add real-time updates

3. **Deploy**
   - Host on Vercel, Netlify, or VPS
